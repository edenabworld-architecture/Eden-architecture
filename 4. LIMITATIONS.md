LIMITATIONS — Scope, Boundaries, and Non-Claims
This document states what this research does notestablish.These limitations are not temporary disclaimers; they define the work.


1. No claims of general intelligence
This research does notclaim to demonstrate, approximate, or imply:
• Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
• Broad human-level reasoning
• Transferable intelligence across domains
Any interpretation suggesting otherwise is incorrect.


2. No claims about consciousness, intention, or agency
The observations described in this repository do notsupport claims about:
• Consciousness
• Awareness
• Intention
• Desire
• Purpose
The language used in associated materials is descriptive, not metaphysical.


3. No real-world guarantees
Nothing in this research establishes guarantees about behavior in real-world environments.
Specifically, it does notclaim:
• Robustness under open-ended conditions
• Stability in uncontrolled settings
• Predictive certainty outside examined contexts
Any appearance of robustness should be treated as context-bound.


4. No claim of optimality or completeness
This work does notclaim that:
• The observed distinctions are exhaustive
• The explored questions are fully resolved
• The investigation has reached a final form
Alternative interpretations and counterexamples remain possible.


5. No reproducibility claim at this stage
This repository does notaim to enable reproduction.
As such, it makes no claims about:
• Reproducible procedures
• Transferable implementations
• Benchmark-level comparability
Reproducibility is treated as a separate phase, not a default expectation.


6. No scaling claims
The observations summarized here do notimply:
• That scaling will preserve observed tendencies
• That larger systems will behave similarly
• That the same distinctions hold at different magnitudes
Scaling behavior remains an open question.


7. No causal attribution
The research does notassert causal explanations for the observed distinctions.
Observed differences should not be read as evidence of:
• Specific mechanisms
• Underlying rules
• Necessary or sufficient conditions
Causal interpretation is intentionally deferred.


8. No competitive comparison
This work does notclaim superiority over existing approaches.
It does notposition itself as:
• A replacement
• An alternative benchmark
• A competing framework
The focus is on inquiry, not comparison.


9. Interpretive responsibility
Readers are responsible for:
• Respecting the stated boundaries
• Avoiding extrapolation beyond scope
• Distinguishing observation from explanation
Misinterpretation due to overextension is outside the intent of this work.


10. Why these limitations exist
These limitations are not hedges.
They exist because:
• Certain questions lose clarity when overextended
• Premature claims distort ongoing investigation
• Integrity requires acknowledging uncertainty
This document defines where interpretation must stop.


Closing statement
The value of this work lies not in what it claims,but in what it refuses to claim.
