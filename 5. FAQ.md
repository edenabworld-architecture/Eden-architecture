FAQ — Frequently Asked Questions
This FAQ exists to prevent misunderstanding, not to invite discussion.


Q1. Is this research about AGI?
No.
This work does not claim, pursue, or imply Artificial General Intelligence.
Any interpretation framing this research as AGI-related is incorrect.


Q2. Is this trying to model human intelligence or cognition?
No.
The research does not model human cognition, psychology, or behavior.
Any similarity in language is descriptive, not representational.


Q3. Does this replace large language models or existing AI systems?
No.
This research does not replace, compete with, or subsume existing systems.
It addresses a different class of questions.


Q4. Does this guarantee zero error or perfect prediction?
No.
The research makes no guarantees about error elimination, either in theory or in practice.
Any mention of reduced error is context-dependent and non-generalizable.


Q5. Why is there no code or runnable example?
Because this repository is not intended to provide an implementation.
The purpose of this repository is to clarify questions and boundaries, not to enable reproduction.


Q6. Will code or detailed methods be released later?
There is no commitment to release implementation details.
Disclosure decisions are intentional and selective.


Q7. Can I reproduce the experiments described here?
No.
This repository does not contain sufficient information for reproduction, by design.


Q8. Is this a theoretical paper or a practical system?
Neither.
This work sits between theory and implementation, focusing on experimental distinctions rather than formal proofs or deployed systems.


Q9. Is this research peer-reviewed?
Not at this stage.
The current materials represent an ongoing investigation, not a finalized publication.


Q10. Can this be applied to real-world problems now?
No.
This research is not positioned as an application-ready approach.


Q11. Why make any of this public at all?
Because some questions benefit from being stated clearly and publicly, even when answers are incomplete.
Public disclosure here serves clarity, not completeness.


Q12. Who should notengage with this repository?
This repository is not intended for:
• Those seeking immediate applications
• Those expecting full transparency or open methods
• Those looking for optimization recipes or benchmarks
Engagement beyond the stated scope is discouraged.


Q13. How can I get more information or access?
Additional access, if any, is granted selectively.
Public inquiries requesting implementation details will not be answered.


Q14. Is discussion or contribution welcome?
General discussion is not solicited.
This repository is not open to pull requests or feature contributions.


Closing statement
This FAQ is not an invitation to ask better questions.It is a boundary that defines which questions are appropriate here.
