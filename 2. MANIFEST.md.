MANIFEST — Scope and Disclosure Boundary
This document defines what this repository contains,and—equally important—what it intentionally does not.


1. Purpose of this manifest
This manifest exists to make the scope of disclosure explicit.
It clarifies:
• What materials are publicly available
• What materials are intentionally withheld
• Why this separation exists
• How this repository should be interpreted
This document is part of the research design.


2. Publicly disclosed materials
The following categories of material are included in this repository:
• Conceptual descriptions of research questions
• High-level summaries of observed distinctions
• Statements of intent, limitations, and non-claims
• Contextual explanations for whycertain approaches were chosen
These materials are provided to establish:
• The legitimacy of the research question
• The boundaries of the investigation
• The seriousness of the research posture
They are notprovided to enable reproduction or extension.


3. Intentionally withheld materials
The following materials are notincluded in this repository:
• Experimental procedures or protocols
• Parameter values or thresholds
• Evaluation metrics or scoring rules
• Step-level or time-series logs
• Source code or implementation details
• Automation scripts or pipelines
• Instructions, recipes, or tutorials
The absence of these materials is intentional and permanent at this stage.


4. Rationale for non-disclosure
Some research questions depend on howdistinctions are made, not merely whatresults are obtained.
Premature disclosure of implementation details would:
• Collapse interpretive judgment into mechanical replication
• Incentivize surface-level reproduction without understanding
• Distort the trajectory of an ongoing investigation
For these reasons, disclosure is limited to conceptual scope rather than procedural detail.


5. On verification versus reproduction
This repository aims to support verification of intent, not reproduction of results.
Readers are encouraged to assess:
• Whether the questions are meaningful
• Whether the distinctions proposed are coherent
• Whether the stated limitations are responsibly drawn
Readers should not expect:
• A complete method
• A runnable system
• A transferable implementation
Verification and reproduction are treated as distinct activities.


6. Interpretation guidance
This repository should be read as:
• A declaration of inquiry
• A record of questions asked
• A boundary-setting document
It should not be read as:
• A technical specification
• A benchmark submission
• A tutorial or guide
Any attempt to derive implementation from this material misrepresents its purpose.


7. Access beyond this repository
Additional materials, if shared at all, are provided selectively and under explicit terms.
Access decisions consider:
• Research integrity
• Interpretive capacity
• Alignment with the intent of the investigation
Access is notautomatic and is notguaranteed.


8. Legal and ethical notice
All materials in this repository are provided for informational purposes only.
No license is granted to:
• Reproduce the research
• Implement derived systems
• Create derivative works
All rights are reserved.


9. Closing statement
This manifest does not hide information.It defines the boundary at which information stops being helpfuland starts being harmful to the question itself.
