EXPERIMENT_OVERVIEW — Observational Scope
This document summarizes what kinds of questions were explored,without describing how they were implemented.


1. How to read this document
This overview does notdescribe experiments as procedures.
Instead, it presents them as sets of observationsthat emerged when specific questions were examined under controlled circumstances.
No experiment in this document should be interpreted as:
• A method
• A protocol
• A reproducible recipe
This document exists to establish what was looked at, not how it was done.


2. Categories of questions explored
Across multiple investigative passes, the research focused on three broad categories of questions.
These categories are intentionally described without technical framing.


A. Limits of error reduction
Question addressed:
• Do all errors decrease in the same way when system capability increases?
Observed distinction:
• In some situations, errors continued to decrease as capacity increased.
• In other situations, errors stopped decreasing beyond a point, despite further changes.
Interpretive note:
• This difference appeared to depend on factors beyond raw capability alone.


B. Sensitivity to environmental conditions
Question addressed:
• How does changing surrounding conditions affect the persistence of observed behavior?
Observed distinction:
• Certain patterns changed rapidly when conditions shifted.
• Other patterns appeared comparatively resistant to such changes.
Interpretive note:
• Similar performance levels could mask very different sensitivities.


C. Persistence across variation
Question addressed:
• Are some observed tendencies specific to a single situation, or do they reappear across variations?
Observed distinction:
• Some tendencies appeared transient and context-bound.
• Others reappeared in modified circumstances, though not always in identical form.
Interpretive note:
• What repeated was not a fixed outcome, but a recognizable direction of response.


3. What is meant by “observation” here
In this context, an observation refers to:
• A difference noticed across comparable situations
• A tendency that appeared more than once
• A contrast that could not be explained by performance metrics alone
An observation does notimply:
• A rule
• A guarantee
• A general law
Observations are treated as provisional and contextual.


4. What is intentionally omitted
This document omits, by design:
• Counts or frequencies
• Thresholds or boundary values
• Conditions required for occurrence
• Duration or timing details
• Any indication of sufficiency or necessity
These omissions are essential to preserving the integrity of the inquiry.


5. Relationship between experiments
The investigations summarized here are not independent demonstrations.
They should be understood as:
• Iterative probes
• Reframed questions
• Successive attempts to isolate distinctions
No single observation stands alone.


6. Why this overview remains non-specific
Specificity is often mistaken for clarity.
In this case, specificity would prematurely collapse open questions into fixed interpretations.
The purpose of this overview is therefore limited to:
• Indicating that distinctions were observed
• Clarifying the kinds of distinctions
• Avoiding claims about underlying causes


7. Status of these observations
All observations described here are:
• Context-dependent
• Subject to revision
• Insufficient for standalone conclusions
They serve as inputs to an ongoing research process, not as final results.


8. Closing statement
This overview does not explain the experiments.It explains why the experiments cannot yet be explained.
