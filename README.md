EDEN — Core Public Repository
This repository exists to define a question, not to provide an implementation.


1. What problem does this research address?
Modern AI systems have achieved remarkable performance improvements.Yet even in high-performing systems, certain types of errors persist.
This research does notbegin by assuming that all remaining errors are reducible by larger models, more data, or better optimization.
Instead, it asks a more basic question:
Are all errors the same kind of error?
More precisely:
• Are some errors limited by model capacity?
• Are others constrained by the structure of the environment itself?
• And if so, how can these limits be distinguished experimentally?
This repository documents an attempt to separate these questions, rather than collapse them into a single performance metric.


2. What this research is not
To avoid misunderstanding, we explicitly state what this work does notclaim.
This research does notclaim:
• To build or replace AGI
• To model human consciousness or intention
• To provide a general-purpose learning system
• To offer a complete or reproducible method
• To guarantee zero error in real-world environments
Any interpretation along these lines is incorrect.


3. Why performance benchmarks are insufficient here
Standard benchmarks measure how wella system performs.
They rarely clarify whycertain errors remain.
In many real-world settings:
• Observation is incomplete
• Uncertainty is inherent
• Not all structure is recoverable by scaling
When these factors are mixed together, it becomes difficult to tell whether an error reflects:
• A limitation of the model
• Or a limitation imposed by the environment
This research focuses on disentangling these possibilities, rather than optimizing performance under their mixture.


4. What is included in this repository
This public repository contains only the minimum material required to establish the scope and intentof the research.
Included:
• A high-level description of the questions investigated
• A conceptual overview of experimental observations
• Explicit statements of limitations and non-claims
Not included:
• Full experimental procedures
• Parameter settings
• Implementation details
• Evaluation metrics
• Logs or step-level data
This is intentional.


5. Why the implementation is not 공개 (not public)
Some questions lose their meaning when reduced to recipes.
This work is concerned with where questions should be placed, not with providing immediate answers.
Releasing full implementations at this stage would:
• Encourage superficial replication
• Obscure the role of judgment and interpretation
• Undermine the integrity of ongoing investigation
For these reasons, access to detailed materials is intentionally restricted.


6. Current status of the research
The work documented here represents an ongoing research program, not a finished result.
At this stage:
• Certain distinctions appear experimentally observable
• Some assumptions common in AI research appear incomplete
• Several critical questions remain open
No final claims are made.


7. Who this repository is for
This repository is intended for:
• Researchers interested in the limitsof prediction
• Readers concerned with how uncertainty shapes learning
• Investors evaluating research direction rather than product timelines
It is notintended for:
• Those seeking ready-to-run code
• Those looking for immediate applications
• Those expecting definitive answers


8. Contact and access
This repository is publicly readable.
Further access, if granted, is selective and intentional.
Access is treated as part of the research design,not as a default entitlement.


9. License
All rights reserved.
No part of this repository may be used to reproduce, derive, or implement the described research without explicit permission.


Final note
This repository does not attempt to close a question.It attempts to place one correctly.
